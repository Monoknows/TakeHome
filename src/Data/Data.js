      "React — not just a framework, it’s his playground. Components bend to his will. Props and states? They don’t argue — they cooperate. Bro’s building UIs smoother than butter on a hot pancake, turning complex logic into visuals so crisp they make front-end devs shed a tear. ⚛️🔥",

      "JavaScript — this man doesn’t just write JS, he *whispers sweet promises to the compiler*. Async functions fold under his mastery. Callbacks retire when they see him. He debugs with his eyes closed and refactors for fun. His console logs? Poetry in syntax. 🧠💫",

      "HTML — the skeleton of the web and he’s the architect. His structure so clean even Google’s crawler says ‘thank you’. Every div placed with intent, every tag aligned with purpose. He doesn’t just code markup — he crafts digital architecture that would make Tim Berners-Lee blush. 🏗️✨",

      "Tailwind — utility classes tremble when he enters VS Code. His layouts snap so clean they could cut glass. Forget Bootstrap, this dude’s components flex harder than a powerlifter at CSScon. He doesn’t write classes — he composes art in div form. 🌬️💻",
